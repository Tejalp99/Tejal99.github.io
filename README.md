## Projects

### [Shallow Convolutional Neural Network for Image Processing](https://github.com/Tejalp99/SHALLOW-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK-FOR-IMAGE-PROCESSING)

![MT-500x292](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a183a62-1418-4e39-9621-70b964263b1e)

This project explores the potential of shallow neural networks to deliver high performance in image classification tasks by scaling horizontally (increasing width and resolution) rather than vertically (adding depth). The main aim is to reduce computational complexity while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to deeper neural networks.

### [SENTIMENT PLAY: DECODING GAME REVIEWS](https://github.com/Tejalp99/Sentiment-Analysis)

<img width="706" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-16 at 12 40 31 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fc98547-1d83-4c44-9e73-1c522c8d108d">

Developed a sentiment analysis model for video game reviews using NLP techniques to automate the classification of customer sentiments, reducing manual analysis time. Implemented advanced deep learning models like DistilBERT and evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Visualized key findings with Altair and presented actionable insights on customer preferences to the marketing team, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

### [Breast-Tumor-Segmentation](https://github.com/Tejalp99/Breast-Tumor-Segmentation)

![Ultrasound-images-from-breast-tissue-for-normal-benign-and-malignant-80](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ad307f0-e3df-42c3-927e-2afd4179ce98)

Developed a machine learning model using UNET architecture for the segmentation of breast tumor images. The project aimed to automate the detection and classification of breast tumors, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

### [BANK CHURN PREDICTION](https://github.com/Tejalp99/Bank_Churn-Prediction)

![1698802120424](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c8f2ab8-2cf5-4fde-8658-150961bca12b)

Developed a predictive model to identify factors contributing to customer churn in the banking sector and to classify customers at risk of churning. The project aimed to provide actionable insights to reduce attrition and retain valuable customers.
